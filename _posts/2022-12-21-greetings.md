# Welcome to my first blog post. 

The exercise of writing, it's something like an unraveling, while simultaneous weaving together of mental threads. The practice helps me to improve my ability to construct and organize my thoughts and ideas. Similarly to physical exercise but of course, this is an exercise of the mind. So inherently there is indeed a physical aspect.

Going back to edit my writings is also enjoyable. I get to re-acquaint myself with those same concepts that had excited me when I was writing them, but I'll also be able to sculpt them into new and refined versions of the original material.

## What are we looking at here?

Well I have a track record of being a serial half-ass personal website maker so there's the possibility that this is another iteration of that. What I mean is that I've created several personal websites because the exercise of just going through the process of creating is an interesting challenge, but in the end they get "archived" some short time after initial release. 

I'd like to say it's been just about the fun of solving the puzzle of getting different types of web setups up and running just because that's a worthwhile exercise of it's own, like building a model of some sort, if you're into that type of thing.

I'd like to believe that reasoning. Really though, the reason I hadn't been keeping up is because I simply hadn't been taking the time for myself!

## "But this time will be different!"

Alright, settle down there guy. We know you're super serious this time. ðŸ™„

Anyway, I started this in order to hopefully re-kindle that flame. Whether it sticks or not this time is entirely up to me and how I choose to spend my time.

## What is this website built with?
You're seeing my thoughts written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), being constructed into a web page on a simple static blog theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which is a theme for a static site generator called [Jekykll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I had to register my domain name through a typical provider, and to be honest that's all there is to it!
