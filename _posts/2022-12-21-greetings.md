# Welcome to my first blog post. 

The exercise of writing, it's something like an unraveling, and simultaneous weaving together of mental threads. It's good for illuminating conciousness and it also helps me to improve the construction of thoughts and ideas. Similar in a way to some of the benefits of physical exercise. Of course, this is an exercise of the mind. And the mind seems to be quite connected to the body.

Going back in and editing something I've written is also enjoyable. I get to re-acquaint myself with those same ideas and concepts that had excited me when I was writing them, and I also get to sculpt them into new refined versions of my woven thoughts.

## What are we looking at here?

Well I'm a serial half-ass personal website maker. What I mean is that I've created several personal websites because it was an interesting challenge, ended up deleting them some short time after initial release, and then started over at some point later.

I'd like to say it's been just about the fun of solving the puzzle of getting different types of software stacks up and running just because that's a worthwhile exercise of it's own if you're into that type of thing.

I'd like to believe that. Really though, the reason is just plain and simple. Not taking the time for myself!

## "But this time will be different!"

Alright, settle down there guy. We know you're super serious. ðŸ™„

Anyway, I started this in order to hopefully re-kindle that flame. Whether it sticks this time is entirely up to me and how I choose to spend my time.

## What powers this personal website?
What you're looking at is a simple static blogging theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which is built for a static site generator called [Jekykll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and to be honest that's all there is to it!

Performant, secure, and relatively simple. Not another system to maintain!

## Also, happy Winter Solstice.
