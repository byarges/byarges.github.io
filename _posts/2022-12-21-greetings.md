# Welcome to my first blog post. 

The exercise of writing is like an unraveling of threads, along with a weaving of those threads into new patterns. This practice improves my ability to construct and organize my thoughts and ideas. It's similar to physical exercise in many ways, but of course, this is an exercise of the mind. Therefore, there is an inherent physical aspect.

Editing my writings is also enjoyable. I can re-acquaint myself with those same concepts and ideas which I had been excited about, but they can now be further sculpted and refined.

## What are we looking at here?

To be honest, I have a track record as a serial, half-ass personal website maker so there is the possibility that this may be just another iteration of that pattern. What I mean is that I've created several other personal websites in the past because the exercise of just creating something from scratch is an interesting challenge. In the end these projects have been archived and removed some time later.

I'd like to say it's been just about the fun of solving the puzzle of getting different types of setups up and running in different environments just because that alone is an intriguing exercise.

I'd like to believe that reasoning. Really though, the reason I hadn't been keeping up is simply because I haven't taken the time for myself to maintain those pursuits. In summary, because I just haven't.

## "But this time will be different!"

Alright, settle down there guy. We know you're super serious this time. üôÑ

Anyway, I started this site in order to hopefully re-kindle that flame. Whether it sticks or not this time is entirely up to me and how I choose to spend my time.

## Really though, what are we looking at here?
You're seeing my thoughts written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which gets constructed into a web page rendered with a static blog theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which is built for a static site generator written in called [Jekykll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), my domain name is registered through a typical provider, and to be honest that's all there is to it!

## Happy Winter Solstice ‚ù§Ô∏è
