# Welcome to my first blog post. 

The exercise of writing is involves unraveling and weaving together of mental threads. The practice helps me to improve my ability to construct and organize my thoughts and ideas. Similar to physical exercise, but of course, this is an exercise of the mind. Which means inherently there is indeed a physical aspect.

Editing my writings is also enjoyable. I can re-acquaint myself with the same concepts that I had been excited about, but they can be sculpted and refined.

## What are we looking at here?

I have a track record of being a serial, half-ass personal website maker so there's the possibility that this is just another iteration of that pattern. What I mean is that I've created several other personal websites because the exercise of just going through the process of creating something is an interesting challenge, but in the end these projects get "archived" some time after initial release. 

I'd like to say it's been just about the fun of solving the puzzle of getting different types of setups up and running just because that alone is an intreaguing exercise.

I'd like to believe that reasoning. Really though, the reason I hadn't been keeping up is because I simply hadn't been taking the time for myself to do so!

## "But this time will be different!"

Alright, settle down there guy. We know you're super serious this time. üôÑ

Anyway, I started this in order to hopefully re-kindle that flame. Whether it sticks or not this time is entirely up to me and how I choose to spend my time.

## Really though, what are we looking at here?
You're seeing my thoughts written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which gets constructed into a web page rendered with a static blog theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which is built for a static site generator written in called [Jekykll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), my domain name is registered through a typical provider, and to be honest that's all there is to it!
