# Greetings And Happy Winter Solstice

## Welcome to my first blog post

The practice of writing can be a very enjoyable thing but it's work. It's something that feels like an unraveling, and simultaneous weaving together, of threads. The exercise of writing has an effect on not only the clarity of my present mental state but also helps me to be better able to construct thoughts overall. Similar in a way to exercise. Of course it really is an exercise of the mind.

## What are we looking at here?

Well, I've created several personal websites over the years that all just end up rusting to the point where I just end up deleting them. Hey they're fun challenges to get up and running in different ways and with different environments. I built them all with the intent of them acting as a creative conduit and an outward representation of my thoughts, work, ideas, and interests. Maybe some sort of professionalism in there as well, who knows? Plus the idea of being able to communicate widely and independently through the elements of the digital arts is just exciting to me. Even if it's only one other person who ends up reading this. That prospect has always been exciting. Problem is, I always get to the point where I've completed a rough version of my vision for such a project, throw it into the web, and then it sits. 

I'd like to say it's usually been because the act of solving these puzzles to get the project up and running is really what it's all been about anyway. I'd like to paint that story. It would be a good story to tell my ego about my champion mindset. Really though, the reason is just plain and simple. Not taking the time for myself to build something that's just for me.

## "But this time will be different!"

Alright, settle down there guy. We know you're sooo super serious. ðŸ™„

Anyway, I started this in order to re-kindle that flame. Whether it sticks this time is entirely up to me and how I choose to spend my time.

## The Technology:
It's a simple static blogging theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which is built to work with a static site generator called [Jekykll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and that's all there is to it!

Performant, secure, and relatively simple. Not another system to maintain!
