# Welcome to my first blog post. 

The exercise of writing is like an unraveling of threads, along with a weaving together of those threads into new patterns. This practice improves my ability to construct and organize my thoughts and ideas. It's similar to physical exercise in many ways, but of course, this is an exercise of the mind. Therefore, there certainly is a physical aspect since the body and mind are connected.

Editing my writings is also enjoyable. I can re-acquaint myself with those same concepts and ideas which I had been excited about, but they can now be further sculpted and refined.

## What are we looking at here?

To be honest, I have a track record as a serial, half-ass personal website maker so there is the possibility that this may just end up being another iteration of that pattern. What I mean is that I've created several other personal websites in the past because the exercise of just creating something from scratch is an interesting challenge and I seem to like those types of challenges. Unfortunately, these projects end up just being archived and then removed some time later.

I'd like to say that this cycle has been just about the fun of solving the puzzle of getting different types of setups up and running in different environments just because that alone is an intriguing exercise.

I'd like to believe that reasoning. Really though, the reason I hadn't been keeping up is simply because I hadn't been taking the time for myself to continue those previous pursuits.

## "But this time will be different!"

Alright, settle down there guy. We know you're super serious this time. üôÑ

Anyway, I started this site in order to hopefully re-kindle that flame. While I'm at it, learning about the concept of static website generation using some fun tools. Whether it sticks or not this time is entirely up to me and how I choose to spend my time.

## Really though, what are we looking at here?
You're seeing my thoughts written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which ends up getting constructed into a web page and rendered into a static blog theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) which is designed for a static site generator, written in Ruby, called [Jekykll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), my domain name is registered through some typical provider, and to be honest that's all there is to it!

## Happy Winter Solstice! ‚ù§Ô∏è
